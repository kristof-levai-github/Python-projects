Create a python program that calculates the arithmetic and geometric mean of two positive numbers. 
The code should work for real (decimal) numbers as well. Print the results!

To calculate the arithmetic mean of two numbers x and y:
Arithmetic Mean = (x + y) / 2

To calculate the geometric mean of two numbers x and y:
Geometric Mean = sqrt(x * y)
