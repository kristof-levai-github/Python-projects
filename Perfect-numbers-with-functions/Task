Request a positive integer (N > 1) in a controlled manner and count how many perfect numbers there are from 1 to N.
A perfect number is a number that equals the sum of its proper divisors (e.g., 6 = 1 + 2 + 3; 28, 496, 8128, etc.).
In case of incorrect input, print: Invalid input.

Use the provided code skeleton for the solution, and ensure that the return type, function name (identifier), and parameter list of the functions adhere to the given requirements.
