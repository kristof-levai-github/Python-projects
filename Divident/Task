Write a C program that reads two integers and prints the division result in the following format: dividend / divisor = quotient, remainder: x.
Solve the same problem for real (double type) numbers as well. To calculate the division remainder, use the math.h function double fmod(double, double).

Example input:
101, 2
Example output:
101 / 2 = 50, remainder: 1
