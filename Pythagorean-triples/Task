Let's consider Pythagorean triples from 1 to 100. These are the positive integers that can form the sides of a triangle, satisfying the triangle inequality:
a < b < c and c â‰¤ 100.
Which is the triple for which the difference between a, b, and c is 10?
Write this triple in the following format: p, q, r (where p, q, and r are the respective numbers, and the difference between them is 10).
