"Write a program suitable for billing phone usage charges. Calculate the phone usage charges after N calls, categorized by call types (1-foreign, 2-outside network, 3-inside network). The call duration should be provided by the user in minutes.
Tariffs: foreign calls 100 HUF/minute, outside network calls 60 HUF/minute, inside network calls 40 HUF/minute.
Display the total amount of the bill."

This program would allow users to input the number of calls made for each call type (foreign, outside network, inside network) and their respective call durations in minutes.
The program would then calculate the total charges based on the given tariffs and display the final bill amount.
