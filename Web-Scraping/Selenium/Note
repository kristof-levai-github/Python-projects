Selenium is a popular web automation and testing framework that can also be used for web scraping.
It allows you to automate interactions with web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and others.
Selenium can programmatically control a browser, navigate web pages, interact with page elements, and retrieve data from websites.
While it's often used for web testing and automating repetitive tasks, it's also a valuable tool for web scraping when other traditional scraping methods like parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup or using requests are not sufficient.
