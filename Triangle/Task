Write a Python program that calculates the area of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides. Use the Heron's formula: tÂ² = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where a, b, and c are the lengths of the triangle's sides, and s is half of the triangle's perimeter.
Display the calculated area and perimeter!
Pay attention to variable types! To determine the area, use the square root function: double sqrt(double num). The declaration of this function is included in the math.h standard header file.
