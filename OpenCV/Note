What is OpenCV? 

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library designed primarily for real-time computer vision applications.
It was originally developed by Intel and later supported by Willow Garage and Itseez.
OpenCV is written in C++ and has bindings for various programming languages, including Python, Java, and more, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.

OpenCV provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions for image and video processing, object detection, face recognition, feature extraction, camera calibration, and many other computer vision tasks.
The library is widely used in both academia and industry for a variety of applications, including robotics, augmented reality, surveillance, medical imaging, and more.
