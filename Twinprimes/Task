Request a positive integer (N > 1) in a controlled manner and count how many twin prime number pairs there are from 1 to N.
In case of incorrect input, print: Invalid input.
ATTENTION! 1 is not a prime number, so (1, 3) is not a twin prime number pair.
Twin primes are prime number pairs that differ by 2, e.g., (5, 7).
Use the provided code skeleton for the solution, and ensure that the return type, function name (identifier), and parameter list of the functions adhere to the given requirements.

Tests:

InvalidInput_negativ_test
• Inputs: -5
• Expected output: Invalid input (included)
InvalidInput_0_test
• Inputs: 0
• Expected output: Invalid input (included)
